# Slice packet — V3

## The criterion

- **Problem**: Flow reads and writes its documents only at fixed paths under `root:`, so a team whose decisions, product context or guidelines live in another tool (a wiki, a project board) can't point Flow at them, and the files its guidelines cite reach the agents only by chance.
- **Outcome**: a project declares, per kind of document, where it lives, through which adapter and with which writing peculiarities; Flow reads, writes and searches there and brings each agent the sources it needs. With nothing declared, everything stays under `docs/` as today.
- **Less about**: rewriting Flow's steps (review, gate, close); shipping adapters for specific services inside Flow; deciding for a project which document goes where; copying a territory's content into the repo.
- **Measure**: a document or change serves this work if it lets an agent or a teammate reach the right source without a human relaying it, leaves an unconfigured project behaving exactly as before, and puts no token or public share link in a repo.

## Slice V3 (from slices.md)

## V3 — The adapter contract and its resolution

**In**
- `territories:` in `.flow.yml`: one entry per kind (`decisions`, `changelog`, `guidelines`, `lenses`, `product`, `archive`), each `adapter`, `where`, `write`. Undeclared kind → the repo, under `<root>/`, as today. When `territories: changelog` is declared it wins over `changelog.path`, and the opening says so; `labels`, `language` and `decisions` still apply.
- `shared/territories.md`: the contract.
  - `## Requires`; `## Fields`: native fields when the service has them, else the key/value table; `## Operations`: `read`, `write` (`written` or `proposed <link>`), `search`, `list`, `archive`, each with its input and return.
  - `search` and `list` take keywords and files and return at most ten lines, or write their result to a scratch file whose absolute path they return.
  - An adapter has no `context: fork` (it would bring back the fork-to-connector path the decision rules out) and no `disable-model-invocation: true` (the Skill tool could not call it).
  - The repo as the contract's reference behaviour; A10's lines on tokens, per-user values and share links (also in the README).
- Resolution in the conductor, on the design adapter's pattern: the qualified skill name from `territories:`, invoked by the Skill tool, `## Requires` read first; a missing skill or unmet requirement stops the step and names the territory. Adapters resolve **before the profile**, since the profile may read a guidelines territory. One adapter invocation per step.
- `/flow:dev` profile: shows the declared territories at opening. (`/flow:project` homes have no `.flow.yml`: out.) The key list in `skills/dev/SKILL.md` and `skills/docs/SKILL.md`'s configuration table, `docs/architecture.md`.

**Out**: any read or write through an adapter (V4, V5).

**Done**
- The throwaway test adapter, written only from `shared/territories.md`, resolves: opening a work in the test repo lists its territories. This is the first real check that a skill of another plugin is called by qualified name.
- The test adapter's skill removed → the conductor stops and names the territory.
- No `territories:` → nothing changes at opening.
- Read-through: `shared/territories.md` and the README carry A10's lines and the two forbidden frontmatter keys.
- Gate green.

**Gotchas**: `presets:` already maps `design=<skill>`; keep `territories:` separate so a territory never reads as a stack. Carried from V2's final review (low): in `skills/dev/SKILL.md` ~:297 the planner's step block depends on any `sources:` being declared instead of on a `step: plan` source; fix it while editing that file. Routing for `review`, `execute` and `close` sources was never exercised in V2's test repos.

## Lessons

Rules learned while executing, one per line. Every plan and packet carries them.

- In `claude -p`, `--allowedTools "<list>"` is variadic and swallows a prompt argument after it; pipe the prompt on stdin.
- A Verified line that forbids a literal (`rg -n '\*-<slug>'` → no output) also forbids quoting it in prose; plan the check to match only the command, or word the prose without it.
- A slug lookup by substring (`rg "<slug>"`, `*-<slug>`) matches longer slugs; anchor it on the exact field (`^work: <slug>$`, or the backticked slug with `-F`).
- A skill's glob over `<root>/work/*/` gets `2>/dev/null`, as `shared/work.md` does, so an empty folder reads as no match.
- In `claude -p`, a check that asks the model to print the prompts it would build is flagged by the safety classifier (`reasoning_extraction`); ask instead for a routing table of which files each dispatch carries, and grep that.
- A file whose text reaches a committed document (a packet, a ledger) must be tracked by git (`git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>`), or an ignored local secret lands in the repo.
- When the plan's example and the one the first task writes differ, rule on one form at the first review and hand it word for word to every later task that copies it.

## Test level

none

## Guidelines (docs/development-guidelines.md, sections that apply)

## Tests

Level: none
Sensitive areas:

No test framework. A slice is verified by running what it changed:

- `claude plugin validate .` for anything under `.claude-plugin/` or `skills/`;
- a throwaway test repo, created outside this repo (in the session scratchpad or `/tmp`), for loading, naming and settings behaviour. Never committed;
- for a change to a skill's instructions, a read-through against the brief and the skills that cite it.

Every behaviour of Claude Code a document states is either verified in a spike or a slice, or linked to the official docs page that says it.

## Naming

- A skill's folder is its `name:`, kebab-case: `skills/dev/SKILL.md` has `name: dev`.
- User-invocable skills are cited as `/flow:<skill>` in every document. Skills that aren't user-invocable (`flow:docs`, `flow:stack-<name>`, `flow:design-<tool>`) and agents (`flow:planner`, …) are cited as `flow:<name>`, with no slash. Dependency skills are cited by bare name, with the plugin form in brackets at the first mention: `shaping` (`shaping-skills:shaping`). The brackets go only at a dependency's first mention in each skill, bare afterwards.
- No names of specific user projects or personal tools anywhere. Examples use invented names.

## Language

English in every file, commit message and work document.

## Commits

Imperative mood, English, one concern per commit. Explicit `git add <paths>`, never `-A` or `.`. No `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root (`claude plugin validate` warns on it).

## Gate

Green before a slice closes, in order, from the repo root. The link check skips links inside fenced code blocks, where templates hold placeholder links. Both `rg` calls name the path (`.`): without one, `rg` reads stdin when it isn't a terminal and hangs.

```bash
claude plugin validate .        # passes; expected warnings: missing version and icon, the folder also holding a marketplace manifest
# old names: the only allowed matches are in shared/work.md § Upgrade and in the README's
# § Upgrading from an older Flow; nothing else.
# --hidden so .claude-plugin/ is searched too
rg -n -i --hidden '\bdevflow\b|devflow-(docs|archive)|projectflow|\.devflow\.yml' \
  --glob '!.git' --glob '!.git/**' \
  --glob '!docs/work/**' --glob '!docs/briefs/**' --glob '!docs/CHANGELOG.md' \
  --glob '!docs/development-guidelines.md' .
# every relative Markdown link resolves: prints "file -> target" per broken link, nothing when green.
# Add --glob '!path' to the rg --files call for the narrowing a work's slices.md sets.
rg --files --glob '*.md' --glob '!docs/work/archive/**' . | while read -r f; do
  awk '/^ *```/{x=!x; next} !x{s=$0; while(match(s,/\]\([^) ]+/)){print substr(s,RSTART+2,RLENGTH-2); s=substr(s,RSTART+RLENGTH)}}' "$f" |
    while read -r t; do
      case "$t" in http*|mailto:*|\#*) continue;; esac
      test -e "$(dirname "$f")/${t%%#*}" || echo "$f -> $t"
    done
done
```

While a work is in progress, its `slices.md` may narrow the Gate (for example, files a later slice rewrites); the narrowing ends with that work.

## Matching decisions

- docs/decisions-log/2026-10-31-territory-adapters-run-in-the-conductor.md — "Territory adapters run in the conductor's main session; flow:docs stays file-based. Rules out adapters behind flow:docs and a local mirror."
- docs/decisions-log/2026-10-29-main-session-grows-less-not-cleared.md — "The /flow:dev conductor keeps context low by growing less, not by asking for /clear at every slice close; a new session is only suggested at a natural pause."
- docs/decisions-log/2026-10-29-slice-execution-runs-in-a-runner-subagent.md — "A slice's execution runs in one background subagent, flow:slice-runner; the main session keeps stops, STATUS.md and commits. No /clear, no /compact."
- docs/decisions-log/2026-10-27-design-is-agnostic-skill-plus-tool-adapter.md — "Design is a tool-agnostic /flow:design skill plus a replaceable tool adapter chosen via the presets chain; rules out one skill fused with Pen."
- docs/decisions-log/2026-10-26-stack-presets-are-replaceable-skills.md — "Stack knowledge ships as opinionated flow:stack-<name> skills; a project or user maps a stack to a custom skill that replaces the shipped one entirely."
